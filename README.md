1. Many more boys than girls or other/non-disclosed buy items for this game- they buy more than 5x the amount of items than girls and other/non-disclosed combined.
2. The age group that buys the most about of items and spends the most amount of money for this game is 20-24 year olds. As the age range gets older and younger from 20-24, the amount of items bought and the amount of money spent decreases the older and younger the age range gets. However, 35-39 year olds spend the most amount of money per person.
3. The age group with the amount of players is 20-24 year olds. As the age range gets older and younger from 20-24, the amount of players decreases the older and younger the age range gets.
